               Chickens came to the New World by the earliest Spanish settlers and Polynesian explorers around the 1300s to early 1500s. More chickens arrived in worldly waves through European and British colonization with total inhabited global coverage by the early 1700s.

The original value of raising chickens was for their egg production with meat as a byproduct. It wasn’t until the 21st century that factory farms began producing both meat and eggs cheaply, increasing the demand.

In 2002, there were more than 16 billion chickens in the world, being raised for food, eggs, or as pets. China represented the majority at 3.8 billion with the US coming in second at 1.9 billion.  Worldly estimates today put that population at around 50 billion.
